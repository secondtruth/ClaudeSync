# ClaudeSync GUI Implementation Summary

## Overview
A clean, modern GUI for ClaudeSync built with CustomTkinter that provides visual access to all major ClaudeSync functionality without needing to remember command-line syntax.

## Architecture

### Minimal Invasive Design
- **Separate Package**: GUI code lives in `src/claudesync/gui/` 
- **Optional Dependency**: GUI is an optional install with `pip install claudesync[gui]`
- **CLI Wrapper**: GUI calls existing CLI commands via subprocess - no core logic duplication
- **Independent Entry Point**: `csync-gui` command or `python -m scripts.launch_gui`

### File Structure
```
src/claudesync/gui/
â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py              # Main application window and navigation
â””â”€â”€ views/               # Individual view components
    â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
    â”œâ”€â”€ projects.py      # Project management view
    â”œâ”€â”€ sync.py          # Sync operations view
    â”œâ”€â”€ workspace.py     # Workspace management view
    â””â”€â”€ settings.py      # Settings configuration view
```

## Implemented Features

### 1. Authentication View (`main.py`)
- Login/logout functionality
- Session key authentication
- Real-time status updates
- Direct link to Claude.ai

### 2. Projects View (`views/projects.py`)
- List all available projects
- Create new projects with name, description, and path
- Set active project in any directory
- Visual indication of current project
- Quick sync buttons (placeholder for now)

### 3. Sync View (`views/sync.py`)
- Push/Pull/Sync operation modes
- File category selection (all_files, source_code, etc.)
- Dry run option for previewing changes
- Real-time output display with scrolling
- Progress bar animation
- Thread-based execution to prevent UI freezing

### 4. Workspace View (`views/workspace.py`)
- Browse and set workspace directory
- Discover all local ClaudeSync projects
- Clone all remote projects to local workspace
- List discovered projects with paths
- Quick open project folders
- Placeholder for batch sync operations

### 5. Settings View (`views/settings.py`)
- Tabbed interface (General, Sync, Advanced)
- All major configuration options:
  - Log level
  - Max file size
  - Upload delay
  - Two-way sync toggle
  - Prune remote files option
  - Compression algorithm
  - Submodule detection filenames
- Load current settings from CLI
- Save changed settings back to CLI

## Key Implementation Details

### Command Execution
The `run_csync_command()` method tries multiple approaches to ensure compatibility:
```python
commands = [
    ["csync"] + args,                           # If in PATH
    ["python", "-m", "claudesync.cli.main"] + args,  # Module execution
    [sys.executable, "-m", "claudesync.cli.main"] + args  # Current Python
]
```

### Thread Safety
- Long-running operations (sync, clone) run in separate threads
- Queue-based communication between threads and UI
- Main thread handles all UI updates via `root.after()`

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks around all CLI calls
- User-friendly error dialogs
- Graceful fallbacks for missing functionality

## Usage

### Windows Launch Options
1. **Batch File**: Double-click `ClaudeSync_GUI.bat`
2. **Direct Python**: `python -m scripts.launch_gui`
3. **Command**: `csync-gui` (if installed with pip)

### Workflow Example
1. Launch GUI
2. Login with Claude.ai session key
3. Navigate to Projects â†’ Create new project
4. Go to Sync â†’ Select options â†’ Start sync
5. Monitor real-time progress and output

## Benefits Over CLI
- **Visual Feedback**: See auth status, current project, sync progress
- **No Command Memorization**: All options in dropdown menus and buttons  
- **Error Prevention**: Validation and confirmations before destructive operations
- **Multi-Project Management**: Easy switching between projects
- **Batch Operations**: Clone/sync multiple projects at once

## Future Enhancements
- Chat management integration
- Sync history and logs viewer
- Auto-sync scheduling with visual configuration
- File browser for .claudeignore editing
- Conflict resolution UI for two-way sync
- System tray integration for background operation

## Technical Notes
- Uses CustomTkinter 5.2.0+ for modern UI components
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Requires Python 3.10+ (same as ClaudeSync)
- All paths are handled with pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
- Subprocess calls use proper escaping and error handling
